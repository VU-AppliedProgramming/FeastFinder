        "instructions": "Soak 20 bamboo skewers for at least 2 hours in a glass of water. This is to prevent the sticks from burning and breaking when placed under the grill or over the coals., Add the ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric powder, chilli powder, salt, saugar, coconut cream and vegetable oil in a large bowl., Mix well., Cut the chicken into long thin strips.Marinate the chicken in the sauce. Ensure the chicken are well coated.Tightly seal the bowl with cling wrap and place in the fridge. Leave to marinade for at least 4 hours. The longer, the better.In the meantime, prepare the sauce.Look for a reputable brand of satay sauce. I always use Lee Kum Kee., Add about 6 tablespoons of the satay sauce into a bowl.The rest of these steps are to be done, subject to taste. I like to taste as I add the other condiments., Add the crunchy peanut butter, coconut cream and water. If the sauce is too thick, thin it down with a little more water., Add the dark soy sauce, sugar and ground peanuts, Seal the bowl with cling wrap and set aside until ready to serve. Before serving, warm the satay sauce in the microwave oven, covered slightly, for approximately 1.5 to 2mins.When you are ready to grill the chicken, start forming satays by piercing the chicken through the bamboo skewers. I find it alot easier to pierce the meat into the sticks when they are long strips and I pierce through in an undulating manner.  Set aside until ready to use.Preheat your oven to 200 deg Celsius at GRILL., Place your oven shelf higher and closer to the top too., Lay the satay sticks on a cooling mesh sitting over a flat baking sheet to collect drippings., Place the tray of satay under the grill. And grill for 10 to 20 mins. It really depends on how thick your chicken sticks are., Remove the tray from the oven when one side of the satay is a golden brown (not dark brown!). Turn over the satay to the other side. And continue to grill till it has a nice dark golden brown. I like it a little burnt., Serve warm with satay sauce and sliced cucumber., ",
