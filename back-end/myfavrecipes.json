Ensure the chicken are well coated.Tightly seal the bowl with cling wrap and place in the fridge. Leave to marinade for at least 4 hours. The longer, the better.In the meantime, prepare the sauce.Look for a reputable brand of satay sauce. I always use Lee Kum Kee., Add about 6 tablespoons of the satay sauce into a bowl.The rest of these steps are to be done, subject to taste.

Before serving, warm the satay sauce in the microwave oven, covered slightly, for approximately 1.5 to 2mins.When you are ready to grill the chicken, start forming satays by piercing the chicken through the bamboo skewers. I find it alot easier to pierce the meat into the sticks when they are long strips and I pierce through in an undulating manner.  Set aside until ready to use.Preheat your oven to 200 deg Celsius at GRILL., Place your oven shelf higher and closer to the top too., Lay the satay sticks on a cooling mesh sitting over a flat baking sheet to collect drippings., Place the tray of satay under the grill.
